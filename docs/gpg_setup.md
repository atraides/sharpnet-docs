# How to setup GPG and SSH agent

## Linux

Original documentation [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GnuPG#gpg-agent)

```sh
gpg --full-gen-key --expert
```

## Windows

### Requirements

- A compatible Yubikey
- A current version of GnuPG software
  - Windows: [GPG4Win](https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html)
  - macOS: [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/gpgsuite.html)
  - Linux: Pre-installed on most distributions

### Install and configure GPG4Win

!!! notice
    Before you begin make sure [GPG4Win](https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html) is installed on your Windows box.


#### Start GPG

```
gpg-connect-agent /bye
```

#### Enable SSH support for GPG

```cfg title="%APPDATA%\gnupg\gpg-agent.conf"
enable-putty-support
enable-ssh-support
use-standard-socket
default-cache-ttl 600
max-cache-ttl 7200
```

#### Restart GPG

```shell
gpg-connect-agent killagent /bye
gpg-connect-agent /bye
```

#### Download wsl-ssh-pageant

Download [WSL-SSH-pageant](https://github.com/benpye/wsl-ssh-pageant/releases/tag/20201121.2) and save it locally on your machine. This will be used to connet GPG with the SSH on Windows 10/11.

#### Automate GPG and WSL-SSH-pageant

Create a new **Symlink** in your Startup folder for the **GPG Agent** and the **WSL-SSH-pageant**.

```text title="%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\GPG Connect.lnk"
"C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg-connect-agent.exe" /bye
```

```text title="C:\Users\sid\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\wsl-ssh-pageant.lnk"
C:\Tools\wsl-ssh-pagent\wsl-ssh-pageant-amd64-gui.exe -force -systray -verbose -winssh winssh-pageant
```

Finally set an environment varible for the SSH Agent Socket using [this guide](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/windows-set-environment-variable#ftoc-heading-4)

```ini
SSH_AUTH_SOCK="\\.\pipe\winssh-pageant"
```

![ENV_SSH_AUTH_SOCK](https://atraides.github.io/sharpnet-docs/images/ENV_SSH_AUTH_SOCK.png)

#### Restart and Test the SSH Agent connectivity




### Generating Keys externally

!!! warning
    It is strongly recommended that you to generate keys on an offline system, such as aÂ live Linux distribution like Ubuntu. Note that with live Linux, certain packages (like scdaemon) may need to be installed manually.

#### Generate a new GPG Signing key

```shell
gpg --expert --full-gen-key
```

When prompted select to specify the key type choose **9** or **1** for RSA if you have a YubiKey NEO.

```shell
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 9
```

In the next step we are going to specify the "length" of the key. For a newer elliptic curve the recommended value is **1 (Curve 25519)**. For the RSA keys the length depends on the key type.

- For a YubiKey NEO, select **2048**
- For a YubiKey 4 or 5, enter **4096**

```shell
Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519 *default*
   (2) Curve 448
   (3) NIST P-256
   (4) NIST P-384
   (5) NIST P-521
   (6) Brainpool P-256
   (7) Brainpool P-384
   (8) Brainpool P-512
   (9) secp256k1
Your selection? 1
```

The next question is about the expiration of our new key. The default value is **unlimited** however, for production use it is recommended to specify this value.

```shell
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
```

Next we have to enter our personal information

- Real Name **Be sure to enter both your first and last name.**
- Email Address
- If desired, a Comment about this key

```shell
GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Daniel H******
Email address: daniel@h******.hu
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Daniel H****** <daniel@h******.hu>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
```

!!! warning
    Make sure to use a strong passphrase for the key and store it somewhere safe ( It is strongly recommended to use a password manager )

!!! info
    While the key is being generated, move your mouse around or type on the keyboard to gain enough entropy.

When the key is been generated, you will see several messages displayed. Make a note of the key ID, that is displayed in the message such as "```gpg: key E353B******** marked as ultimately trusted```". The key ID in this case is ```E353B********``` and you will need this key ID to perform other operations.

```shell
gpg: revocation certificate stored as 'C:\\Users\\dh***\\AppData\\Roaming\\gnupg\\openpgp-revocs.d\\E353B********.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.

pub   ed25519 2022-12-29 [SC] [expires: 2024-12-28]
      E353B***********************************
uid                      Daniel H****** <daniel@h******.hu>
sub   cv25519 2022-12-29 [E] [expires: 2024-12-28]
```

#### Add a new GPG Authentication key

```shell
gpg --expert --edit-key E353B******** # Use the key ID from the previous command
```

```shell
addkey
```

As a first step we have to select the new key's type. The recommended is ```(11) ECC (set your own capabilities)``` for Elliptic Curve and ```(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)``` for RSA.

```shell
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) Elgamal (encrypt only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)
   (7) DSA (set your own capabilities)
   (8) RSA (set your own capabilities)
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (11) ECC (set your own capabilities)
  (12) ECC (encrypt only)
  (13) Existing key
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 11
```

During the next step we have to select the key usage type. By default the allowed actions are Signing/Encrypt or Signing. Make sure to toggle off both Signing and Encrypt and enable Authenticate.

```shell
Possible actions for this ECC key: Sign Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Sign

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished

Your selection? s

Possible actions for this ECC key: Sign Authenticate
Current allowed actions:

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished

Your selection? a

Possible actions for this ECC key: Sign Authenticate
Current allowed actions: Authenticate

   (S) Toggle the sign capability
   (A) Toggle the authenticate capability
   (Q) Finished
```

In the next step we are going to specify the "length" of the key. For a newer elliptic curve the recommended value is **1 (Curve 25519)**. For the RSA keys the length depends on the key type.

- For a YubiKey NEO, select **2048**
- For a YubiKey 4 or 5, enter **4096**

```shell
Please select which elliptic curve you want:
   (1) Curve 25519 *default*
   (2) Curve 448
   (3) NIST P-256
   (4) NIST P-384
   (5) NIST P-521
   (6) Brainpool P-256
   (7) Brainpool P-384
   (8) Brainpool P-512
   (9) secp256k1
Your selection? 1
```

In the last step we have to choose an expiration date for this key as well.

```shell
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y
Key expires at 28-Dec-24 19:43:24 Central Europe Standard Time
```

Confirm the creation of the new key and enter the passphrase from the previous step.

```shell
Is this correct? (y/N) y
Really create? (y/N) y
```

Once they new key is added we should see it in the new details

```shell
sec  ed25519/EC79************
     created: 2022-12-29  expires: 2024-12-28  usage: SC
     trust: ultimate      validity: ultimate
ssb  cv25519/75B1************
     created: 2022-12-29  expires: 2024-12-28  usage: E
ssb  ed25519/6C87************
     created: 2022-12-29  expires: 2024-12-28  usage: A
[ultimate] (1). Daniel H********** <daniel@h**********.hu>
```

#### Create a backup of your key

```shell
gpg --export-secret-key --armor E353B******** # Use the key ID from the previous command
```

!!! warning
    Store the text output from the command in a safe place ( e.g. Save the text in password managers, save the text on a USB storage device ).

### Import the new key to your YubiKey

```shell
gpg --expert --edit-key E353B******** # Use the key ID from the previous command
```

```shell
keytocard
```

Select the signing key first and provide your passphare and Admin PIN to move the key to the card.

```shell
Really move the primary key? (y/N) y
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key
Your selection? 1
```

Repeat the same step for the authentication key

```shell
gpg> keytocard
Really move the primary key? (y/N) y
Please select where to store the key:
   (1) Signature key
   (3) Authentication key
Your selection? 3
```

Once both the Signing and the Authentication key is moved to the YubiKey switch to key slot #2 and move the Encryption key as well.

```shell
key 2
```

```shell
gpg> keytocard
Please select where to store the key:
   (2) Encryption key
Your selection? 2
```

Finally execute ```save``` to exit gpg and finalize your changes. You can verify the changes with ```gpg --card-status```

```shell
gpg --card-status
```
